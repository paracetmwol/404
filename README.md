# Falling-Apart üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: 404


### Team Members
- Member 1: Adarsh Menon - SSET
- Member 2: Amal N A - SSET

### Project Description
A completely chaotic and utterly useless 404 error page that gets progressively more unhinged the longer you stay. Features random sounds, multiplying buttons, runaway elements, and eventual system meltdown.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Error pages are too boring and predictable. When users get lost on the internet, they deserve a proper descent into madness, not just a simple "Page Not Found" message. We're solving the critical issue of 404 pages being too sane and professional.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created the most chaotic 404 page possible that:
- Shakes and rotates elements randomly üåÄ
- Spawns emoji invasions ü´†üòµüî•
- Changes fonts to increasingly questionable choices
- Plays random meme sounds üîä
- Features buttons that run away from your cursor üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Displays increasingly unhinged error messages
- Eventually explodes into complete digital chaos üí•

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS for styling and animations
- Vanilla JavaScript for chaos management
- Web Audio API for sound effects
- DOM Manipulation for dynamic content
- CSS Transforms & Animations for visual effects

# Installation
No installation needed! Just clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/paracetmwol/404.git
```

# Run
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Wait 4 seconds for chaos to begin
3. Click the button (if you dare)
4. Watch your sanity slowly disappear
5. Try to survive until the final explosion
